### Part Count:
571

### Positioning:
1/4 wall off ground; space with terrain modifier as needed

### Terrain Assumptions:
6 multilevel pillars allow for uneven terrain, but of course works just fine on flat terrain as well. Original design was placed on a large hillhtop.

### Powerlines:
No source

### Helpful Information:
Noticeable power consumption from cuboids, biodomes, and teleporter. Adding an electrical cloaking device is recommended, perhaps under the base computer enclosure.
